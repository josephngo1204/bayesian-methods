# Bayesian Methods
#### My work/assignments with bayesian problems include: 

- defining prior distributions and likelihood functions
- computing posterior probabilities of each model (log-likelihoods for efficient computing)
- using Metropolis-Hasting Monte Carlo and kombine to perform sampling from the posterior distribution
- computing the integral of posterior distribution (or take the sum of all posterior probabilities of each parameter and divide by total number of initial samples taken from dataset)
          - allows for the computation of the log model evidence and Bayes factor
- enforcing consistency between different models
- impact of increased outlier sensitivity on model performance
- learning dataset weights
